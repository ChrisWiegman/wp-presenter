WP Presenter Theme
====================

A WordPress theme based on reveal.js.

Welcome to the Beta Release of WP Presenter

Built using reveal.js, WP Presenter showcases the versatility of WordPress - it's more than "just a blog!"

WP Presenter was created specifically to allow presentations to be built and presented from within a local WordPress environment, eliminating the need for a wifi connection at WordCamps. 

There are many functionalities and customization options present and the testing phase needs more eyes than just the few people who have helped pull this together. We are aware of certain bugs and are working to resolve them; however, we are welcoming the public to download, install and utilize this theme at your convenience.

Please note: As this theme is in Beta, we will continue to push updates. Please make sure you are using the latest release if you run into a function and can't tell if it's a bug or a feature! Feel free to report any issues you find and they will be addressed.

Pull requests are welcome but not required. Enjoy!
